# Robustness

TiPlay's supported product is an Android phone plus a car browser. This document
tracks fault boundaries and recovery guarantees across that product. The audit
baseline is `42db8dca`; its beta.36 product build is `c1ad4b32`. The follow-up work
preserves original-codec RTP video, independent native Opus audio, software audio
fallback, the Bluetooth microphone route and SCO silence keepalive.

## Recovery contracts

Every asynchronous result belongs to the generation and resource owner captured
when its work starts. Re-read ownership before publication, after blocking work
and at final callback delivery. Late work may close its own resources, but must
not publish into, stop or clear a replacement. A short state lock must not cover
external network/library startup, device teardown or an unbounded join.

Cancellation and cleanup are separate observations. Cancellation must become
visible promptly. Opaque platform/library work may finish later; its outstanding
resources and cleanup status must stay accounted for. A timeout must not falsely
declare a radio lease released or permit old cleanup to stop a new owner.
If an opaque library never returns, radio ownership remains quarantined; later
attempts report that cleanup is outstanding. A cleanup exception retains the
failed lease for the process lifetime. These cases may require an app restart;
the application cannot forcibly cancel the library or assert that it released
the radio.

Known media failures need a bounded recovery or an explicit stream-specific error.
Normal idle and successfully displayed static video are valid states. Neither an
absent configuration before projection starts nor a low frame rate alone proves
failure. Rejecting a configuration that has actually arrived is different: it
must not leave a healthy-looking transport silently dropping all frames.

Microphone/SCO ownership, codec output and audio focus are distinct. Report a
downlink decoder failure without pretending that a physically active route has
closed. Transient focus loss may wait for the retained request's gain; permanent
loss and owner retirement must release it. Existing busy-route checks continue
to prevent taking another application's call route.

## Remediation map

The following 19 items have source fixes on top of beta.36 and pass the required
source regression checks. Browser/cache v112 is prepared but not published. This
is a source-work record, not a release or a claim of vehicle acceptance.

| Audit | Boundary | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Tunnel adoption | Capture run/handler ownership; reject and close late old results. |
| A2 | Wireless cancellation | Invalidate promptly; perform blocking cleanup outside state locks with a real budget and tracked ownership. |
| A3 | Queued wireless status | Recheck the original generation at final delivery. |
| A4 | Paired-car request | Explicit user retry works after an accepted request fails; ordinary observations remain idempotent. |
| A5 | Invalid video configuration | Publish a video-only failure or bounded recovery, preserving normal idle. |
| A6 | Call downlink decoder | Bound codec restart and publish current-stream failure; preserve microphone/SCO ownership. |
| A7 | Audio focus | Distinguish transient/delayed/permanent focus and reject stale owner callbacks. |
| A8 | WakeLock | Old grant/reject/release cannot clear or leak the replacement lock. |
| A9 | Native trace temporary files | Clean abandoned app-owned trace staging directories at process initialization. |
| A10 | Wired optional diagnostics | Keep temporary syslog work out of the CarKit critical path; release untransferred Lockdown ownership on failure. |
| A11 | Keyframe command | Bound the actual event write and cancel only the command's socket owner. |
| A12 | First Canvas submission | Independently bound time to first successful presentation, with generation-safe acknowledgement. |
| A13 | Diagnostic callback work | Keep native/system callbacks lightweight; defer metadata with explicit bounded admission and integrity loss reporting. |
| A14 | Log snapshot | Budget queue draining and storage-lock acquisition together; return explicit partial history on timeout. |
| A15 | Archive storage | Read the fixed journal descriptor directly; retry staging-output failure once per private root and retain raw evidence on failure. |
| A16 | Bonjour input | Bound candidate work, first status-line bytes and total probe time. |
| A17 | Browser upgrades | Do not force a new worker protocol into a running old page. |
| A18 | Native dependency identity | Route local vendor artifacts exclusively and verify the final APK against the pinned AAR. |
| A19 | Native symbols | Retain symbols and Build ID indexes for future producer outputs without changing committed binaries. |

The candidate concerning an Activity losing the only session-end recovery event
was withdrawn after tracing the normal type-130 close through `Failed` and the
retained reporter. It is not part of the remediation count.

## Diagnostics and storage

Original media ingress retains its full, synchronous capture contract. Small
diagnostic metadata can use bounded asynchronous admission to keep system/native
callbacks responsive. Saturation, oversize or failure must be counted against
the originating capture session and mark it incomplete; it is not sampling and
must not be hidden. A late metadata task must never enter a later capture.
Stopping/exporting a capture must account for admitted but undelivered metadata.

An export may omit unavailable history only with an explicit partial marker.
Prepared reports remain immutable and reusable across destination fallbacks.
Compressed media journals stay byte-identical in a STORED ZIP; only added report
and trace content is Zstandard-compressed. Failed storage must preserve original
capture evidence. Staging-space requirements and failure must be truthful.

System native traces are opaque bytes. Match PID, time, module, relative PC and
Build ID before attribution, and reject an old ANR as evidence for a native crash.
Producer symbol archives must match their stripped output's Build ID. A fresh
build with a different Build ID cannot retrospectively symbolize an old binary.
Historical missing symbols cannot be recovered by a source-only patch.

## Browser update boundary

Worker upgrades must preserve the existing page/worker protocol as one version.
The conservative update policy lets the new service worker wait until all old
controlled TiPlay pages leave; it must not claim that a same-page disconnect or
reload is sufficient. This policy does not establish atomicity for an initially
uncontrolled network load across an external CDN deployment.

## Verification and remaining device evidence

The complete [AGENTS](../AGENTS.md) Android command passed: 4,535 unit cases
(2,613 shared, 1,916 common and six home), mobile/home/maphost Debug lint and all
three Debug assemblies. Node 22 passed all 690 browser cases. The 49 Python
checks cover native symbols, the WebRTC build driver, final-APK verification,
release drafts and site deployment. The freshly assembled mobile Debug APK also
passes the pinned WebRTC identity/provenance, four-ABI ELF and ZIP-alignment gate.
Public-tree, cache, workflow syntax and documentation word-limit checks pass.
Actual AGP Release JNI compilation and stripping also pass: all 24 module/ABI
pairs have matching Build IDs and retained line tables/symbol tables, backed by
`NDK_DEBUG=0` configurations. This does not qualify a signed Release APK or upload.

Real Chromium checks cover legacy-to-waiting service-worker updates with two
pages and Processor/Canvas main/Worker paths using a local capture track. They
do not establish a vehicle RTP path or hardware decoding. New owner, failure,
deadline and storage tests exercise the blocked operation or actual transition.
See [Testing](Testing.md) for reproducible source checks and their limits.

Future WebRTC/audio producer rebuilds and authenticated durable symbol archives
have not been executed for this source revision. No committed AAR or native
binary was replaced, and no new APK, Pages deployment or remote CI was published.

The previous native SIGSEGV still lacks its matching native backtrace. These
changes do not establish its cause or prove ARM64 vehicle continuity. Hardware
acceptance still includes sustained calls with transient focus, actual graphics
context loss, existing Wi-Fi handoff, slow storage and native trace retrieval.
See [Diagnostics](Diagnostics.md) for capture and [Build](Build.md#current-browser-deployment)
for the last published artifact's separate evidence.
